# What Makes a House Worth More?  
Our project files for our Data mining project about predicting California housing prices written by Theo Lavandier and myself, Jake McCoy. The jupyter notebook file contains our implemenations, tests and grapsh we conducted for our project. There is some order in the cells starting with intial graphs and preprocessing all the way down to our final models and there accuracy.  

**Loading the file**  
You can load the file through a local Anaconda installation or use Google Colab (which is how we choose to run our project file so we know for sure this works). As long as you make sure each previous cell has been run than the code should run as we intend it to with correct outputs. A link to our project report will be listed below aswell as a copy of the report in this Github repository.

Feel free to direct any questions to my email the.mccoy@outlook.com for clarification on either the code or the report.
